## Interruption driven development

This is part 3 of the [series](https://princiya.com/blog/tags/transition/). In the previous [post](https://princiya.com/blog/learn-what-not-to-do/), I wrote about the challenges with time management and how I learned to get better at it.

> Timing is everything! Once I learned to identify the important things, it got better over time to decide what not to do.

In this post, I will talk about one of the time management strategies called the [Eisenhower Method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_management) and how it helps me in my day-to-day work as an Engineering Manager.

## Interruption driven development

I work as an Engineering Manager at Anaconda. Being in a leadership position means I am constantly interrupted by various things.

I am also a Leadership Fellow for WWCode and manage the frontend community and volunteers there. I have written about how I manage my time between these two roles [here](https://princiya.com/blog/thankful/#time-management).
