When a child is born it immediately trusts its parents without even knowing what trust is and starts to learn and grow up. Trust is important in any kind of relationship, and so is trust important in everything that we do.</p>\n<p>The first thing I had to learn when I started leading a team was to delegate tasks to others, and to do this I had to trust them to be able to finish the task.</p>\n<p>It is very important that your team trusts you and vice-versa.

Even if it were talking to someone and saying <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;hey, we should get lunch together sometime! üç≤&quot;</code></li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt procrastinate things; there can never be a better time than doing it now</li>\n<li>When someone asks you a question, post updates or follow up with conversations in a timely manner before the other person asks you the second time</li>\n<li>Be a listener, not just wanting everyone to listen to you. Let others lead, enable them to.</li>\n<li>Apologise your mistakes in public to your team. It is ok to do mistakes but it is your behaviour to improve that matters to the team. Beginners especially will then learn that everyone can make mistakes and there is room for error. Remember, we are all humans!</li>\n<li>Be consistent in all of these things mentioned above.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Consistency is the key to earn or lose trust!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you consistently do all the things mentioned above, then it is easy to build and earn trust; the opposite is true when you consistently fail on all of the above.</p>\n<p>What communication patterns have you employed in your team or what was the first problem that mattered to you to solve as a leader?
