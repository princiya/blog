You have come this far, finished a term successfully despite the pandemic, so this is something you will definitely cherish one day.\nAt the beginning of the fellowship, we had a Q&#x26;A and one fellow asked -</p>\n<p>Does life as a software developer ever get boring after years of work?</p>\n<p>Now that you have completed a term, I would like to answer by asking a question to all of you, how does it feel? Are you bored?</p>\n<p>Was it challenging?\nWere the days exciting?\nDid you think of giving up?</p>\n<p>Now, take a moment to reflect on the thing you did prior to this fellowship. It could be your college graduation, or a recent university exam.</p>\n<p>Do you notice any similarities with the questions I just asked?\nBored\nChallenging\nExciting\nGive up</p>\n<p>Life as a software developer too goes through these phases, most of the time!</p>\n<p>Failures will come along the way, you may not get your desired promotion or it might take lot of time until you land your first job. When I graduated in 2009, almost 11 years ago, there was a global recession and things didn’t go as planned for me.\nI cried a lot the day after my first failed job interview. It was the first biggest failure for me.\nLooking back at it, If I were to advice my younger self, then I would say that Everything happens for good.\nIf you aren’t being rejected more than accepted, you’re not asking for enough, reaching high enough and valuing yourself enough. Try new things, do things you are scared of. </p>\n<p>if the plan does not work, change the plan, have a plan B! Avoid changing the goal itself! most importantly, have a goal in your life, always!</p>\n<p>It’s the tiny habits that you will cultivate along the way that will help you shape your career into a successful one. Be honest, trustworthy and be true to yourself and your job.\nDon’t be guilty if you decide to binge watch Netflix or just get a good sleep and enjoy being lazyful over the weekends.\nTake breaks, drink water, workout, focus on your health. Health is wealth.\nNothing is easy and you need to keep learning and working hard all the time. Work hard, but smart!</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Advice to my younger self - Part 2","tags":["mentorship","advice","q&a"],"date":"December 05, 2020","spoiler":"Motivational career advice from a mentor to a mentee","cta":"Manage priorities"},"fields":{"slug":"/graduation/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/graduation/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/procrastination/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"procrastination","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Procrastination or Elimination?","tags":["leadership","draft"]}},"next":null,"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
