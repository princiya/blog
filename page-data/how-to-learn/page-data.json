How to learn new things at this rate? To answer this question, it is important to know atleast one tool / technology / framework. To know something in depth it takes time, and this is where experience counts. It is important to invest in the learning mindset early on and to continue with this throughout. Embrace the learning culture throughout and never settle down.</p>\n<h2 id=\"breadth-vs-depth\"><a href=\"#breadth-vs-depth\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Breadth vs depth</h2>\n<p>I often get asked this question about how to learn.</p>\n<h3 id=\"early-years---breadth-first\"><a href=\"#early-years---breadth-first\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Early years - breadth first</h3>\n<p>If you are early on in your career or beginning your career I advice folks to try out various topics before deciding what to focus in depth. Be curious, ask questions and learn new topics. Think like a child, who is curiously exploring various topics. The surrounding environment needs to be supportive too and should arouse your curiousity. It is very important to have mentors at this stage who will guide you and show you directions to explore more.</p>\n<p>Like a child who should first learn to crawl before learning to walk, during early years it is also important to focus on the core fundamentals which will serve to be the basis as you advance.</p>\n<p>Let‚Äôs say you are interested in frontend development. During the early years you should not settle only on frontend but focus on core programming skills and get exposure to various topics. This is how a typical software engineering curriculum works or how we are exposed to various subjects in school before we deep dive into certain streams based on our interests.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To beginners my advice is to focus on breadth vs depth, be open to exploring different areas and topics until you get to settle down on something which you truly enjoy. This phase will come but you need to be patient (3/5)</p>&mdash; Princiya üëß‚Äç (@princi_ya) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/princi_ya/status/1365584292374401026?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 27, 2021</a></blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"later-on---depth-first\"><a href=\"#later-on---depth-first\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Later on - depth first</h3>\n<p>Once you are past the early years phase is a good time to focus on niche areas or deep dive into the topics that you were passionate about during your breadth first exploration phase.</p>\n<p>Now is a good time to indentify if you want to focus on frontend, backend, fullstack, etc. Learn more about the subject, do more of it, practice more of it to get better. </p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">To mid level, my advice is to focus on a niche area, get better at it or even excel on that topic.
