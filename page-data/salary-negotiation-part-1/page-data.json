Although I had 5+ years of software development experience, I was placed in a junior category. When I learned this I was extremely frustrated and since then I was keen on fixing the salary gap to match my skills and experience.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2021, I have been living and working in Germany for the last 5.5 years of which since 3 years I have been in a tech leadership role and an active hiring manager. In this post, I will summarise how I was able to negotiate to a higher pay scale and jot down my experience in salary negotiation both as an interviewee at a big tech and interviewer from a small tech.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-am-i-writing-this-article\"><a href=\"#why-am-i-writing-this-article\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why am I writing this article</h3>\n<p>Most of the advice I have found so far is aimed at salary negotiations at big tech companies. What happens at small-scale tech companies? For example, in my current role, I am the Head of Engineering and also an active hiring manager. There is no full-time recruiter and most of my experience with salary negotiations as an interviewer has been mostly learning things on the fly and improving myself over the years.</p>\n<p>I am also a woman of color from an underrepresented group in tech and the psychology with negotiations is different from the majority. Surprisingly, as I sat down to write this blog post I realized that I never considered adding salary negotiation as a topic into my interview preparation checklist.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I am writing a blog post on salary negotiations and I am surprised that all these years, as an interviewee I never considered preparing myself to be a better negotiator.</p>&mdash; Princiya üëß‚Äç (@princi_ya) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/princi_ya/status/1392840615289704448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">May 13, 2021</a></blockquote>\n\n<h3 id=\"this-is-one-way-to-close-the-gender-pay-gap-in-tech\"><a href=\"#this-is-one-way-to-close-the-gender-pay-gap-in-tech\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>This is one way to close the gender pay gap in tech</h3>\n<p>We need to talk more openly about salary negotiation skills to close the gender pay gap in tech.

Berlin, for example, has lower salaries compared to the rest of Germany. Salaries in the US are different compared to salaries in the EU. Software engineering is a diverse field; salaries vary based on your domain if you are a freelance vs full-time employee or the location you are based at. Before you are ready for negotiations, it is very important to learn and understand the job market and the possible salary range based on experience level.</p>\n<h3 id=\"understand-the-job-market-and-salary-ranges\"><a href=\"#understand-the-job-market-and-salary-ranges\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Understand the job market and salary ranges</h3>\n<p>I use <a href=\"https://www.levels.fyi/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">levels.fyi</a> often.
