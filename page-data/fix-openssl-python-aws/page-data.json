Recently, I had to run a script on my machine which until then was only run by one person in our office. The problem started with us having different <a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">openssl</a> versions. I had <code class=\"language-text\">LibreSSL</code> vs the other person had <code class=\"language-text\">OpenSSL</code>.</p>\n<p>This started creating one problem after the other. For example the script passed in <code class=\"language-text\">pbkdf2</code> argument into the <code class=\"language-text\">openssl</code> cipher and this wasnâ€™t supported in <code class=\"language-text\">LibreSSL</code><a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61938795/openssl-pbkdf2-option-no-longer-supported\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Link</a></p>\n<p>I updated <code class=\"language-text\">openssl</code> to the correct version to support the above mentioned <code class=\"language-text\">pbkdf2</code> cipher; the next error was the following <code class=\"language-text\">Error: No available formula with the name &quot;python@2&quot;</code></p>\n<p>I tried to reinstall python@2 like <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/63725223/2672494\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">this</a>.</p>\n<p>This fixed the openssl error, but the <code class=\"language-text\">awscli</code> was broken and got the following error <code class=\"language-text\">ERROR:root:code for hash md5 was not found.</code></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>As of Feb. 10, 2020, python@2 was removed from homebrew.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I followed the steps mentioned <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/59816812/2672494\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a>, but <code class=\"language-text\">awscli</code> was still broken.</p>\n<p>I updated the <code class=\"language-text\">awscli</code> to <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2-mac.html#cliv2-mac-install-cmd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">version 2</a>.</p>\n<p>Then I tried to add <code class=\"language-text\">awscli</code> to the <code class=\"language-text\">PATH</code> as mentioned <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-macos.html#awscli-install-osx-path\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">here</a></p>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">awscli</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">openssl</code> were both fixed, but now I had to upgrade all <code class=\"language-text\">awscli</code> commands to the version 2.</p>\n<p>For example: <code class=\"language-text\">aws ecr get-login-password</code> <a href=\"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/Registries.html#registry_auth\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">link to connect to docker</a></p>\n<p>It took me one and a half days to finally have the script running on my machine too. I hope this post helps someone.</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Managing pythons on MacOS","tags":["technical","notes"],"date":"September 29, 2020","spoiler":"Handling different python versions on MacOS","cta":"Pythons on MacOS"},"fields":{"slug":"/fix-openssl-python-aws/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/fix-openssl-python-aws/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/performance-appraisals/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"performance-appraisals","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Performance appraisals","tags":["draft"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/5-habits-to-build-trust/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"5-habits-to-build-trust","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"5 habits to build trust","tags":["draft"]}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
