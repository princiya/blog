During this term I have been mentoring for the <a href=\"https://fellowship.mlh.io/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">MLH Fellowship</a> program. The graduation is on 18th December and I was asked to record a ~2 minute graduation speech.</p>\n<p>The following is an excerpt from my speech.</p>\n<p>Hello everyone, congratulations to the graduating batch. You have come this far, finished a term successfully despite the pandemic, so this is something you will definitely cherish one day. At the beginning of the fellowship, we had a Q&#x26;A and one fellow asked -</p>\n<p><strong>Does life as a software developer ever get boring after years of work?</strong></p>\n<p>Now that you have completed a term, I would like to answer by asking all of you,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does it feel? Are you bored?</li>\n<li>Was it challenging?</li>\n<li>Were the days exciting?</li>\n<li>Did you think of giving up?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, take a moment to reflect on the thing you did prior to this fellowship. It could be your college graduation, or a recent university exam. Do you notice any similarities with the questions I just asked?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boring</li>\n<li>Challenging</li>\n<li>Exciting</li>\n<li>Give up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Life as a software developer too goes through these phases, most of the time!</p>\n<p>Failures will come along the way; you may not get your desired promotion or it might take a lot of time until you land your first job.</p>\n<p>When I graduated in 2009, almost 11 years ago, there was a global recession and things didn’t go as planned for me. I cried a lot the day after my first failed job interview. It was the first biggest failure for me.</p>\n<p>Looking back at it, If I were to <a href=\"../lessons-from-my-younger-self\">advice</a> my younger self, then I would say that everything happens for good.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t being rejected more than accepted, you’re not asking for enough, reaching high enough and valuing yourself enough. Try new things, do things you are scared of. </p>\n<p>If the plan does not work, change the plan, have a plan B! Avoid changing the goal itself! Most importantly, have a goal in your life, always!</p>\n<p>It’s the tiny habits that you will cultivate along the way that will help you shape your career into a successful one. Be honest, trustworthy and be true to yourself and your job.</p>\n<p>Don’t be guilty if you decide to binge watch Netflix or just get a good sleep and enjoy being lazyful over the weekends.</p>\n<p>Take breaks, drink water, workout, focus on your health. Health is wealth.</p>\n<p>Nothing is easy and you need to keep learning and working hard all the time. Work hard, but smart!</p>\n<p>I wish you all the best!</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Does life as a software developer ever get boring","tags":["mentorship","advice","q&a"],"date":"December 05, 2020","spoiler":"Motivational career advice from a mentor to juniors in tech","cta":"Career advice for juniors in tech"},"fields":{"slug":"/does-life-get-boring/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/does-life-get-boring/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/procrastination/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"procrastination","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Procrastination or Elimination?","tags":["leadership","draft"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gif-for-social-card-images-gatsby/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"gif-for-social-card-images-gatsby","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to create automated GIF social sharing cards","tags":["gatsby","tutorial"]}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
