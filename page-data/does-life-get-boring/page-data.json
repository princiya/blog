You have come this far, finished a term successfully despite the pandemic, so this is something you will definitely cherish one day. At the beginning of the fellowship, we had a Q&#x26;A and one fellow asked -</p>\n<h3 id=\"does-life-as-a-software-developer-ever-get-boring-after-years-of-work\"><a href=\"#does-life-as-a-software-developer-ever-get-boring-after-years-of-work\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Does life as a software developer ever get boring after years of work?</h3>\n<p>Now that you have completed a term, I would like to answer by asking all of you,</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How does it feel? Are you bored?</li>\n<li>Was it challenging?</li>\n<li>Were the days exciting?</li>\n<li>Did you think of giving up?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now, take a moment to reflect on the thing you did prior to this fellowship. It could be your college graduation, or a recent university exam. Do you notice any similarities with the questions I just asked?</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Boring</li>\n<li>Challenging</li>\n<li>Exciting</li>\n<li>Give up</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Life as a software developer too goes through these phases, most of the time!</p>\n<h2 id=\"failures-and-success\"><a href=\"#failures-and-success\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Failures and success</h2>\n<p>Failures will come along the way; you may not get your desired promotion or it might take a lot of time until you land your first job.</p>\n<p>When I graduated in 2009, almost 11 years ago, there was a global recession and things didn’t go as planned for me. I cried a lot the day after my first failed job interview. It was the first biggest failure for me.</p>\n<p>Looking back at it, If I were to <a href=\"../lessons-from-my-younger-self\">advice</a> my younger self, then I would say that everything happens for good.</p>\n<p>If you aren’t being rejected more than accepted, you’re not asking for enough, reaching high enough and valuing yourself enough. Try new things, do things you are scared of. </p>\n<h2 id=\"goals-and-habits\"><a href=\"#goals-and-habits\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Goals and habits</h2>\n<p>If the plan does not work, change the plan, have a plan B! Avoid changing the goal itself! Most importantly, have a goal in your life, always!</p>\n<p>It’s the tiny habits that you will cultivate along the way that will help you shape your career into a successful one. Be honest, trustworthy and be true to yourself and your job.</p>\n<p>Don’t be guilty if you decide to binge watch Netflix or just get a good sleep and enjoy being lazyful over the weekends.</p>\n<p>Take breaks, drink water, workout, focus on your health. Health is wealth.</p>\n<p>Nothing is easy and you need to keep learning and working hard all the time. Work hard, but smart!</p>\n<p>I wish you all the best!</p>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"Does life as a software developer ever get boring","tags":["mentorship","advice","q&a"],"date":"December 05, 2020","spoiler":"Motivational speech from an MLH mentor to the December 2020 graduating batch","cta":"Career advice for juniors in tech"},"fields":{"slug":"/does-life-get-boring/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/does-life-get-boring/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/learn-what-not-to-do/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"learn-what-not-to-do","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"How I learned to manage my time as a new Manager","tags":["leadership","transition"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/gif-for-social-card-images-gatsby/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"gif-for-social-card-images-gatsby","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"How to create automated GIF social sharing cards","tags":["gatsby","tutorial"]}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}},"staticQueryHashes":["336482444"]}
