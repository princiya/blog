I can only recall that I had read about this somewhere, and ever since, I have been very fond of this sentence.</p>\n<p>Now, as a leader, I always try to be empathetic and supportive, and cannot stress enough on the power of open communication between teams and peers.</p>\n<p>In this post I will talk about 4 effective patterns to bridge the communication gap within your team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pattern-1---tone-of-talking\"><a href=\"#pattern-1---tone-of-talking\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Pattern #1 - Tone of talking</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Do not just ask a question, but also the reason behind the question when it is a slack message.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example</strong>: <code class=\"language-text\">‚ÄúDid you do this, I am asking because I am looking into the same thing now and have some follow up questions‚Äù</code> This helps in reducing the receiver‚Äôs stress rather than <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Hey, did you do this?&quot;</code> and the receiver having to wonder what the message could be about until they get to talk to the sender.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Use emojis or a smile to have a pleasant feel for any conversation.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example #1</strong>: <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;I don&#39;t understand this&quot;</code> vs <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;üôà I don&#39;t understand this&quot;</code>. The former can appear to be yelling at a person while the latter is a milder version of saying that you do not understand something.</p>\n<p><strong>Example #2</strong>: You might be in between meetings, or constantly receiving messages on Slack. Due to the workload, you might be too tired to realize that you are sending a negative tone. During this context, an emoji or a smile can greatly reduce the level of stress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When talking to the team, use generic terms to include everyone. Remember to address the teamwork and not take credit onto yourself or highlight your individual approach to someone.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example #1</strong>: <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;We prefer to use a code linter&quot;</code> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;I like to use a code linter&quot;</code>. Or <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;In this component we have used this logic and it works great&quot;</code> instead of <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;I was the one to write this logic and it works great&quot;</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>Example #2</strong>: When reviewing pull requests, use <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Let‚Äôs do it like this&quot;</code> or <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;Can you please do this instead?&quot;</code> rather than <code class=\"language-text\">Do it like this</code>. Use of emojis also is highly encouraged to maintain a calm tone while reviewing difficult or lengthy pull requests.</p>\n<p>My favorite: <code class=\"language-text\">What do you think</code>?</p>\n<p>Kris example ‚Äî> english word mis-communication</p>","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"title":"Tone of talking","tags":["draft"],"date":"October 05, 2020","spoiler":"4 effective patterns to bridge the communication gap","cta":"People management"},"fields":{"slug":"/tone-of-talking/","langKey":"en"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/tone-of-talking/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/review-pull-request/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"review-pull-request","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"Review pull requests","tags":["draft"]}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/first-problem-to-solve-as-a-leader/","langKey":"en","directoryName":"first-problem-to-solve-as-a-leader","maybeAbsoluteLinks":[]},"frontmatter":{"title":"The first problem to solve as a leader","tags":["leadership"]}},"translations":[],"translatedLinks":[]}}}
