Delegation meant that others were doing things, but this also meant they had frequent queries, and I had to be there to unblock them.

As a <code class=\"language-text\">Lead Engineer</code> my responsibilities are to ensure that we stick to our sprint commitments and ensure a smooth delivery. The first week is usually meetings, sprint plannings, team retrospective for the previous week, etc. The second week is usually the calm week before the storm hitting us at the third weeek. The last (third) week of the sprint is usually busy, with bug fixes happening and supporting the QA team.</p>\n<p>If someone from the Frontend team is sick or on vacation, I keep myself on standby and jump into the sprint to fill their void. This means I cancel meetings that are not relevant to the sprint outcome.</p>\n<h2 id=\"weekend-work\"><a href=\"#weekend-work\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Weekend work</h2>\n<p>During the first months of my leadership role, I used to spend lot of hours on the weekend. Sunday evening meants preparing for Monday mornings. I took some time to realise all the management work I had to do was part of work. Until then I was used to the norm that coding and fixing tickets where I contributed to the team’s velocity chart was core work and all the work which dealt with managaing emails, scheduling hiring interviews, or reading through others pull requests or confluence notes etc. was secondary work.</p>\n<p>Once I got into the mode of accepting the fact that secondary work was part of the primary work too, I got used to the flow.</p>\n<p>By learning that I had to spend only 8 hours everyday doing office work, I got more time to work on my side projects.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learning-to-identify-what-is-more-important\"><a href=\"#learning-to-identify-what-is-more-important\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Learning to identify what is more important</h2>\n<p>At the time of writing this article, we were on the 3rd sprint week. The bi-weekly accountability blog group was expecting us to have our submissions posted today, 29th November 2020 (I started jotting down my ideas only today). I had to decide on the priorities —> sprint release or publish a blog post. Although, publising blog post is just my side project, which I do for fun. This sprint was busy, mainly due to colleagues’ sickness and vacations. We successfully completed the sprint, but I did not publish the blog on time. Did I lose anything? No, did I gain something? Yes offcourse, my colleagues were very happy, and so were our stakeholders.</p>\n<h2 id=\"everything-cannot-be-achieved-at-once\"><a href=\"#everything-cannot-be-achieved-at-once\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Everything cannot be achieved at once</h2>\n<p>I often have a ton of ideas running in my head when I am working on something. For example: I sat down to write this post, but I have so many ideas that I want to write. Can I include all of them, yes, why not! But, will people read or will it be engaging? Probably not! Now I have to decide what is most important for this article. What is the priority right now? I want readers to read this entire article, so I have to identity what not to write!

Recently, I have been getting time to clean my personal inbox only on weekends or once in two weeks. There is something that triggers my brain when I see the unread email / slack notification count in the browser and I want to act on it immediately. But, I stop by and ask myself, is it important? Can it wait? If it’s not important and it can wait, then why not!</p>\n<h2 id=\"too-many-things-yet-too-little-time\"><a href=\"#too-many-things-yet-too-little-time\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Too many things, yet too little time</h2>\n<p>There are only 24 hours in a day. Sometimes I have productive weekends, sometimes lazy. Why are the lazy weekends not considered productive? It is just a thing to convince my brain. What matters in the end is really if I was happy or not. If my body wants to sleep the whole day, then why not? Why is it called lazy? If I like a particular Netflix episode and want to binge watch it, then why not? But don’t stress the eyes, that’s the only important thing.</p>\n<h2 id=\"finding-the-niche-area\"><a href=\"#finding-the-niche-area\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Finding the niche area</h2>\n<p>Starting yesterday, I have uninstalled Facebook and Twitter apps on my mobile phone.
