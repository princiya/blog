Given the current pandemic, I hope this fellowship is something you will definitely cherish one day.</p>\n<p>I have had the opportunity to interact with many of you this season, so thank you to all of you for reaching out to me.\nTo see a happy smiling face at the end of the session or to read the occasional shout outs during your daily standup updates were the most fulfilling moments for me.</p>\n<h2 id=\"identifying-time-crisis-and-how-to-act-on-it\"><a href=\"#identifying-time-crisis-and-how-to-act-on-it\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Identifying time crisis and how to act on it</h2>\n<p>Time management was a common topic during our discussions. The only difference was that some knew and acknowledged they were in a time crisis, but others were shy or hesitated to admit this.</p>\n<p>As you start your career or the next step for yourself in life, this is one of the things you will have to unlearn and learn.
