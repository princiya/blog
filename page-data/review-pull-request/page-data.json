Use of emojis also is highly encouraged to maintain a calm tone while reviewing difficult or lengthy pull requests.</p>\n<p>Write an explanation why you think your changes are necessary. You need to tell the person why your solution / suggestion should be considered and not have them wondering why their problem solving approach cannot be considered. Itâ€™s very important to keep this in mind when you have juniors in your team.</p>\n<p>Encourage everyone to participate in PR reviews. Some need more time to participate and review, especially if they are beginners; if needed include this effort in ticket estimations or story points.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pattern-2---sharing-knowledge\"><a href=\"#pattern-2---sharing-knowledge\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Pattern #2 - Sharing knowledge</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep others informed on what you are doing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example #1</strong>: A best way to update others is by documenting tasks. This also helps in sharing knowledge and enabling more than one person, other than yourself, to do what you can do. This helps a lot if you are a small team or a startup. I wrote a recent <a href=\"../page-data/fix-openssl-python-aws\">post</a> on how it took me 1.5 days to solve a particular task. This problem could have been solved if the knowledge was shared from the beginning on how to perform the same task which was normally done by another person.</p>\n<p><strong>Example #2</strong>: If you solved an issue differently or encountered problems while addressing an issue, write a comment on the ticket or code so that others donâ€™t run into the same problem. As developers we like stackoverflow because someone would have already encountered a problem that we run into.</p>\n<h2 id=\"appreciate-each-other\"><a href=\"#appreciate-each-other\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Appreciate each other</h2>\n<p>We are all humans and can always crave for appreciation in one form or the other.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your peers for their efforts in pull requests, leave encouraging messages especially for juniors or new hires.
