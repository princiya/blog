Use of emojis also is highly encouraged to maintain a calm tone while reviewing difficult or lengthy pull requests.</p>\n<p>Write an explanation why you think your changes are necessary. You need to tell the person why your solution / suggestion should be considered and not have them wondering why their problem solving approach cannot be considered. It‚Äôs very important to keep this in mind when you have juniors in your team.</p>\n<p>Encourage everyone to participate in PR reviews. Some need more time to participate and review, especially if they are beginners; if needed include this effort in ticket estimations or story points.</p>\n<h2 id=\"pattern-2---sharing-knowledge\"><a href=\"#pattern-2---sharing-knowledge\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Pattern #2 - Sharing knowledge</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Keep others informed on what you are doing.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Example #1</strong>: A best way to update others is by documenting tasks. This also helps in sharing knowledge and enabling more than one person, other than yourself, to do what you can do. This helps a lot if you are a small team or a startup. I wrote a recent <a href=\"../page-data/fix-openssl-python-aws\">post</a> on how it took me 1.5 days to solve a particular task. This problem could have been solved if the knowledge was shared from the beginning on how to perform the same task which was normally done by another person.</p>\n<p><strong>Example #2</strong>: If you solved an issue differently or encountered problems while addressing an issue, write a comment on the ticket or code so that others don‚Äôt run into the same problem. As developers we like stackoverflow because someone would have already encountered a problem that we run into.</p>\n<h2 id=\"appreciate-each-other\"><a href=\"#appreciate-each-other\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Appreciate each other</h2>\n<p>We are all humans and can always crave for appreciation in one form or the other.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Appreciate your peers for their efforts in pull requests, leave encouraging messages especially for juniors or new hires.

When a child is born it immediately trusts its parents without even knowing what trust is and starts to learn and grow up. Trust is important in any kind of relationship, and so is trust important in everything that we do.</p>\n<p><strong><strong>The first thing I had to learn when I started leading a team was to delegate tasks to others, and to do this I had to trust them to be able to finish the task.</strong></strong></p>\n<p>It is very important that your team trusts you and vice-versa. Below are some of the habits which I have observed to be effective in letting your team trust you both as a leader and as an individual:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stick to your commitments, however small they are. Even if it were talking to someone and saying <code class=\"language-text\">&quot;hey, we should get lunch together sometime! üç≤&quot;</code></li>\n<li>Don‚Äôt procrastinate things; there can never be a better time than doing it now</li>\n<li>When someone asks you a question, post updates or follow up with conversations in a timely manner before the other person asks you the second time</li>\n<li>Be a listener, not just wanting everyone to listen to you. Let others lead, enable them to.</li>\n<li>Apologise your mistakes in public to your team. It is ok to do mistakes but it is your behaviour to improve that matters to the team. Beginners especially will then learn that everyone can do mistakes and there is room for error. Remember, we are all humans!</li>\n<li>Be consistent in all of these things mentioned above.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Consistency is the key to earn or lose trust!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If you consistently do all the things mentioned above, then it is easy to build and earn trust; the opposite is true when you consistently fail on all of the above.</p>\n<p>What communication patterns have you employed in your team or what was the first problem that mattered to you to solve as a leader? Do let me know.
