After working a few months with freelancers and an external company, we hired a full-time third person into our team. This new hire had to report to me. I was really excited about being able to build a team and was looking forward to her first day. After she started, I realized that things at work were not the same anymore.</p>\n<p>I knew I had to start all over again; this time, I had to start with being a team lead. The first thing I had to learn was to <strong>delegate tasks</strong> to her. By the time I completed my first year at Curalie, we had hired two more additional frontend developers. We were then a team of 5! At the time of writing this blog post (November 2020) we are 12 in our frontend engineering team.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-art-of-delegation\"><a href=\"#the-art-of-delegation\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The art of delegation</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned before, when we hired the third person into our team, I had to learn to delegate tasks to her and to do so, I had to <strong>trust</strong> in her to be able to do things.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The art of delegation was to get comfortable with someone else doing it in a different way than me.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This didn’t come to me naturally, and I was surprised how I was over-protective of the codebase and kept wondering how someone under my supervision would destroy it or not being able to write things correctly. This certainly improved over time and I was getting better at delegating work by breaking down Jira tickets into smaller sub-tasks. Over time, I realized that I only had to tell what to do and not how to do and let her surprise me with her results.</p>\n<h2 id=\"4-key-takeaways-i-learned-from-delegating-tasks\"><a href=\"#4-key-takeaways-i-learned-from-delegating-tasks\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>4 key takeaways I learned from delegating tasks</h2>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; border: 1px solid #efefef max-width: 590px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.89189189189189%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Delegation\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/blog/static/b695192bcf1131ff0c90cff31ce00979/1c72d/birds-leading.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/blog/static/b695192bcf1131ff0c90cff31ce00979/a80bd/birds-leading.jpg 148w,\n/blog/static/b695192bcf1131ff0c90cff31ce00979/1c91a/birds-leading.jpg 295w,\n/blog/static/b695192bcf1131ff0c90cff31ce00979/1c72d/birds-leading.jpg 590w,\n/blog/static/b695192bcf1131ff0c90cff31ce00979/c08c5/birds-leading.jpg 640w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px\"\n      />\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  </p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; font-size: 0.6rem\">Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@rayhennessy?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Ray Hennessy</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/t/nature?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText\">Unsplash</a></div>\n<h3 id=\"not-to-do-everything-myself\"><a href=\"#not-to-do-everything-myself\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Not to do everything myself</h3>\n<p>When working in a fast-paced startup, the team-lead is a people manager while also managing the team’s technical duties, like write code, fix bugs, handle incoming customer support queries, etc. As we were scaling, the key takeaway was that <code class=\"language-text\">I could not do everything</code>, though I loved doing everything or believed that I could do everything. I had to find the balance between managing priorities vs doing things I loved. I had to love the things I did instead.</p>\n<p>For example, learning to manage priorities: Given a 3-week sprint, moving people 1:1’s during the first week gave focus time during the 2nd, 3rd week on sprint goals and releases. Also, in the 3rd week, I had to keep buffer time to align with the QA, fix bugs, and ensure a smooth release.</p>\n<h3 id=\"maintain-a-log-of-delegations\"><a href=\"#maintain-a-log-of-delegations\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Maintain a log of delegations</h3>\n<p>When delegating something to someone, maintaining a delegation log helped in being able to follow up or fill up their place when the delegate was on holiday or sick.</p>\n<p>For example, I always made a point to follow up on every pull request merged so that I could keep track of the changes made or at least remember why, how, when something in the codebase changed.
