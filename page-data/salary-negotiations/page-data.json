Although I had 5+ years of software development experience, I was placed in a junior category. When I learned this I was extremely frustrated and since then I was keen on fixing the salary gap to match my skills and experience.</p>\n<p>Fast forward to 2021, I have been living and working in Germany for the last 5.5 years of which since 3 years I have been in a tech leadership role and an active hiring manager. In this post I will summarise how I was able to negotiate to a higher pay scale and jot down my experience in salary negotiation both as an interviewee at a big tech and interviewer from a small tech.</p>\n<h3 id=\"why-am-i-writing-this-article\"><a href=\"#why-am-i-writing-this-article\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why am I writing this article</h3>\n<p>Most of the advice I have found so far is aimed at salary negotiations at big tech companies. What happens at small scale tech companies? For example, in my current role, I am the Head of Engineering and also an active hiring manager. There is no full time recruiter and most of my experience with salary negotiations as an interviewer has been mostly learning things on the fly and improving myself over the years.</p>\n<p>I am also a woman of color from an underrepresented group in tech and the psychology with negotiations is different from the majority or I am naturally not a good negotiator.

But sometimes you are put in a situation where you will have to atleast give an initial number. These (link above) articles have nice examples and scripts on how you can answer better when you are forced to give a number.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-not-specify-a-salary-range\"><a href=\"#do-not-specify-a-salary-range\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Do not specify a salary range</h3>\n<p>Like anything else, salary negotiation is also an art and gets better with practice. But until you have mastered the art of negotiation or are comfortable in asking for a raise, avoid specifying a range when you are forced to give a number. Example: 50k-55k. When you do this the recruiter often pitches to you with 50k and there is no point in getting 55k. Instead, specify 55k directly which in on the higher end or specify a little higher from your initial expectations so that when the final negotiations are done you might most likely get a figure that would match your expectations.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Specify a number which corresponds to the higher end of your desired salary range.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>When the given position is competitive, then specifying a higher number which does not correspond to the job‚Äôs salary range might also easily disqualify you from further interview rounds. So this one needs to be approached tactically and hence the best advice here is not to specify a number and instead wait for the company to give you an offer and then be ready to negotiate.</p>\n<p>In my hiring experience, given we have a fixed budget and defined salary pay bands for different levels, I like it when candidates give me an initial number upfront so that I can be honest to them and let them know that what they are asking is within the our scope or not. This will save both of us time.</p>\n<h4 id=\"ask-for-the-salary-range-from-the-company\"><a href=\"#ask-for-the-salary-range-from-the-company\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Ask for the salary range from the company</h4>\n<p>Asking a company‚Äôs salary range, for a particular job role that you are interviewing for, before you specify your number works too. I have not tried, or none whom I have hired asked me this question, so I don‚Äôt know how this works. But if someone were to ask me what is the salary range I am to offer them, then I would be honest about this and let them know what is within the scope of our company.

People who have accepted a job offers without negotiating will be able to relate to this. When I accepted my first international job offer (link to background) I didn‚Äôt negotiate and believed that my work would be noticed and I would get a salary that matched my worth. But alas, this does not happen.</p>\n<p>Also what happens is that when there are defined pay bands, it is very unlikely that you get a salary raise unless you switch jobs or jump to another level internally. Internal job switching also depends on organisational policies and does not seem easy. (link to background), when I was frustrated and wanted to fix my pay gap, I did apply and qualify for a job which was in another team at a higher pay band. But the company policy didn‚Äôt let me get a pay raise. The irony was that I would have easily qualified for the higher pay if I had applied as an external to the same job post. I left the company and the job to a better place and money.</p>\n<h3 id=\"do-not-prepare-at-the-last-minute\"><a href=\"#do-not-prepare-at-the-last-minute\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Do not prepare at the last minute</h3>\n<p>Interviews are best performed when you are not in stress.

This will help both internally as well as when applying for your next job.</p>\n<p>While writing down your goals, if you want to continue within your same organization, understand the hierarchy within your organization and know which level you want to get next.
