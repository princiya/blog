I was keen on contributing to opensource and this internship seemed just about right. The fact that it was a paid internship made it more appealing. With no prior opensource contribution experience, I was excited in applying for this internship. But when the results were announced I wasn‚Äôt selected. Here‚Äôs why and how I learned from my failed attempt and succeeded the second time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is always a second chance!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"i-think-i-failed-because--\"><a href=\"#i-think-i-failed-because--\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>I think I failed because -</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>I did not find time to do the preparatory work</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>I had applied almost last minute, and didn‚Äôt have enough time to prepare or learn more about the project</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>I did not pick a project that matched my skills</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>It‚Äôs ok to apply the last minute, but then it‚Äôs better to pick a project where you can make contributions faster</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When I applied for the first time in 2015, the application was due in ~3 weeks time. I applied without doing any homework, i.e. I had no idea about the participating organisations or the type of projects involved. Hence, I lost most of the initial time in scouting through the projects list. Also, if you are late to apply, then you will most likely see the following message from some organisations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This project already has many applicants applying!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since I was late to apply and some of the projects which I was interested in were appealing to others too, I settled with a project which was out of my comfort zone. I applied for <a href=\"https://ignitionrobotics.org/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ignition Robotics</a> which was from <a href=\"https://www.openrobotics.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Open Robotics</a>. The initial work involved working with C++ and Node.js. Back then, I was not comfortable to ask questions to strangers on the internet and chose to do most of the preparatory work myself and when I had a working prototype I contacted the project‚Äôs mentor and emailed them my <a href=\"https://github.com/princiya/Ign3DViz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">solution</a>. I was happy that I did a fair job in attempting to work with C++ and find a solution for D3.js visualisation with Node.js but when the results were announced I was not accepted.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Didn&#39;t get through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/outreachy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#outreachy</a> this time :-( Trying for March :-) renewed energy and enthusiasm. @OSRFoundation <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/d3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#d3</a></p>&mdash; Princiya üëß‚Äç (@princi_ya) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/princi_ya/status/666765603936407552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>\n\n<h2 id=\"faqs-and-tips-for-acing-your-application\"><a href=\"#faqs-and-tips-for-acing-your-application\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>FAQs and tips for acing your application</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What are the chances of getting into the internship?</strong></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How to ensure my application is selected?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This depends with an individual and their application itself, it‚Äôs like clearing an interview and securing your job.</li>\n<li>It is always good to do some homework and have an idea about the participating organisations and their projects so that it will save you time from choosing the right project.</li>\n<li>Outreachy‚Äôs initial round has 6 weeks for you to apply where you are expected to make some initial contributions to the project.</li>\n<li>Every project and it‚Äôs mentors are different.</li>\n<li>Making many contributions to one project usually helps the mentors to assess your skills.</li>\n<li>You can also pick 2,3 projects based on your interests and skills, and always contribute to more than one project.</li>\n<li>I prefer the former approach; making multiple contributions to one project.

Do respect their time, becuase they would be receiving queries from many applicants. Following is a bad example because it shows a lazy behaviour.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Hey, I am interested to apply, can you please help me</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following is a good example because it shows you have researched about the project and are genuinely interested in contributing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Hi, I learned about your project and keen to apply for Outreachy internship.

As I mentioned earlier, it also helps to do the homework in advance so that you can save time in choosing the right project when the applications are due. In terms of the nature of the projects, not all of them involve coding. <strong>There are documentation related projects too!</strong> For projects involving coding work, a general experience with working in open source, remote teams is nice to have along with a baic knowledge of <code class=\"language-text\">git</code> commands.</p>\n<h3 id=\"tip-2\"><a href=\"#tip-2\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>TIP 2</h3>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The new round of applications are now open and if you are overwhelmed by the no. of participating organisations or projects, then you can use this time to learn and understand the process and be well prepared when the next round of applications are due again in 6 months.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It is mentioned that we need to contribute to some open source project during the six week application period.
