I was keen on contributing to opensource and this internship seemed just about right. The fact that it was a paid internship made it more appealing. With no prior opensource contribution experience, I was excited in applying for this internship. But when the results were announced I wasn‚Äôt selected. Here‚Äôs why and how I learned from my failed attempt and succeeded the second time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is always a second chance!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"why-did-i-fail-in-my-first-attempt-for-the-outreachy-internship\"><a href=\"#why-did-i-fail-in-my-first-attempt-for-the-outreachy-internship\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Why did I fail in my first attempt for the Outreachy internship?</h3>\n<p>When I applied for the first time in 2015, the application was due in ~3 weeks time. I applied without doing any homework, i.e. I had no idea about the participating organisations or the type of projects involved. Hence, I lost most of the initial time in scouting through the projects list. Also, if you are late to apply, then you will most likely see the following message from some organisations:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This project already has many applicants applying!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since I was late to apply and some of the projects which I was interested in were appealing to others too, I settled with a project which was out of my comfort zone. I applied for <a href=\"https://ignitionrobotics.org/home\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Ignition Robotics</a> which was from <a href=\"https://www.openrobotics.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Open Robotics</a>. The initial work involved working with C++ and Node.js. Back then, I was not comfortable to ask questions to strangers on the internet and chose to do most of the preparatory work myself and when I had a working prototype I contacted the project‚Äôs mentor and emailed them my <a href=\"https://github.com/princiya/Ign3DViz\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">solution</a>. I was happy that I did a fair job in attempting to work with C++ and find a solution for D3.js visualisation with Node.js but when the results were announced I was not accepted.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Didn&#39;t get through <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/outreachy?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#outreachy</a> this time :-( Trying for March :-) renewed energy and enthusiasm. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/osrfoundation?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">@OSRFoundation</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/d3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#d3</a></p>&mdash; Princiya üëß‚Äç (@princi_ya) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/princi_ya/status/666765603936407552?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 17, 2015</a></blockquote>\n\n<p>Following are the lessons learned from my first failed attempt for the Outreachy internship:</p>\n<h3 id=\"give-yourself-ample-time-for-the-preparatory-work\"><a href=\"#give-yourself-ample-time-for-the-preparatory-work\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Give yourself ample time for the preparatory work</h3>\n<p>I had applied almost last minute, and didn‚Äôt have enough time to prepare or learn more about the project.</p>\n<h3 id=\"pick-a-project-that-matches-your-skill-set\"><a href=\"#pick-a-project-that-matches-your-skill-set\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Pick a project that matches your skill set</h3>\n<p>It‚Äôs ok to apply the last minute, but then it‚Äôs better to pick a project where you can make contributions faster</p>\n<h2 id=\"7-tips-for-improving-your-outreachy-application-2021\"><a href=\"#7-tips-for-improving-your-outreachy-application-2021\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>7 tips for improving your Outreachy application 2021</h2>\n<p>The following is a compilation of the FAQs I receive on Twitter and my tips and suggestions for improving the Outreachy application.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What are the chances of getting into the internship?</strong></li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>How to ensure my application is selected?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>This depends with an individual and their application itself, it‚Äôs like clearing an interview and securing your job.</li>\n<li>It is always good to do some homework and have an idea about the participating organisations and their projects so that it will save you time from choosing the right project.</li>\n<li>Outreachy‚Äôs initial round has 6 weeks for you to apply where you are expected to make some initial contributions to the project.</li>\n<li>Every project and it‚Äôs mentors are different.</li>\n<li>Making many contributions to one project usually helps the mentors to assess your skills.</li>\n<li>You can also pick 2,3 projects based on your interests and skills, and always contribute to more than one project.</li>\n<li>I prefer the former approach; making multiple contributions to one project.

Start talking to the mentors early</h3>\n<p>Each project will have many applicants, so it‚Äôs better you let the project‚Äôs mentor know that you are interested too. Discuss how you plan to apply, ask questions while making the initial contributions, or propose some enhancements to the initial expected contribution.</p>\n<p>Be specific with your question to the mentor. Do respect their time, becuase they would be receiving queries from many applicants. Following is a bad example because it shows a lazy behaviour.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Hey, I am interested to apply, can you please help me</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Following is a good example because it shows you have researched about the project and are genuinely interested in contributing.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">Hi, I learned about your project and keen to apply for Outreachy internship. However, when trying to clone the repository and running the initial command, I did not manage to setup my local environment. I am running on &lt;EXAMPLE OS>, &lt;EXAMPLE BROWSER> etc. Could you please help me out? I also tried to search on the internet for the said issue, and found this &lt;LINK> but it did not help.</code>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What if you‚Äôre a beginner and really finding it difficult to find a simple project to contribute to?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Is Outreachy beginner friendly?</strong></li>\n<li><strong>How can I select a project?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Selecting a project itself will depend on your interests + skills. As I mentioned earlier, it also helps to do the homework in advance so that you can save time in choosing the right project when the applications are due. In terms of the nature of the projects, not all of them involve coding. <strong>There are documentation related projects too!</strong> For projects involving coding work, a general experience with working in open source, remote teams is nice to have along with a baic knowledge of <code class=\"language-text\">git</code> commands.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-do-not-be-overwhelmed-but-learn-as-much-as-you-can\"><a href=\"#2-do-not-be-overwhelmed-but-learn-as-much-as-you-can\" aria-hidden class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>2. Do not be overwhelmed but learn as much as you can</h3>\n<p>If you are overwhelmed by the no. of participating organisations or projects, then you can use this time to learn and understand the process and be well prepared when the next round of applications are due again in 6 months.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It is mentioned that we need to contribute to some open source project during the six week application period. I am new to open source, how to find projects to contribute to?</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If this is your first-time contributing to opensource, I can totally relate to the feeling of being overwhelmed. When I applied for Outreachy the second time in 2017, it took me ~3 months to learn about a project and take the courage to submit my first PR in February 2017.
