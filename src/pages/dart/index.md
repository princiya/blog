Today I tried [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) for the first time. Flutter is Googleâ€™s UI toolkit for building beautiful, natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.

And [Dart](https://dart.dev) is the programming language used to code Flutter apps.

In the past, I have tried hybrid mobile app frameworks, but they all use WebView under the hood.

Dart is quite promising, no WebView and all code written gets compiled to native platforms.

Dart is similar to React Native, but doesn't need to use a bridge like React Native and is even faster.

So if you are looking for a single codebase, multiple platforms, Flutter is your framework of choice.
