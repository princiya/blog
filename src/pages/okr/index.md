# Context

- For Q3, we are working on launching [Objectives and key results (OKRs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) for the company.
- Here's my [recent article](../two-years-into-leadership) about what I accomplished at Curalie GmbH.
- Inspired by the book [Measure What Matters](https://www.whatmatters.com/) and [this article](https://medium.com/tradecraft-traction/this-chart-can-tell-you-when-its-time-to-leave-your-job-6926e0be9228) which describes about what you are good / bad at vs what you like / dislike, I asked my directs to fill in the following table:

|         | Good | Bad |
| ------- | ---- | --- |
| Like    | xx   | xx  |
| Dislike | xx   | xx  |

- The term `Bad` necessarily doesn't mean what you are bad at, but it also means what you want to improve on, sometimes you haven't had the time to do a particular task despite you having liked it etc.
- At first, I did this activity myself and realised how difficult it was to arrive at the columns for ***dislike & bad*** and ***dislike & good***. The latter was easier than the former.
- Having realised this, I asked everyone to think deep and reflect on the nature of the work, learning curve, product etc. to be able to figure out the difficult parts.
- The gist of this table is to ensure that nothing is really there on the ***dislike & bad*** column.
- If something is there then that should be the immediate action item to work on.

# Consequences

- Once this activity was done, the next step was to align this table with the OKRs.
- The alternate way to look at this table is to look at the **Good** and the **Bad** columns from a company's perspective.
- For example, if you mentioned something in the **Bad** column, you could look into this as `if this is really bad for the company`.
- So **Good** for you, might be **Bad** for the company or vice versa.
- Based on this, it gets quite easy to create objectives and key results for a quarter.
