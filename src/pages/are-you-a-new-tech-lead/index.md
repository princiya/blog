Last week I asked on twitter for communities or groups that female leaders in tech were a part of.

The tweet got some nice attention and some of the suggestions I received were helpful. None of them were women specific, and the next thing I had in my mind was this:

Over the weekend I sat down to map my mind on a paper and help myself get what I want.

## What do I want?

Firstly, I had to be clear to myself on what was I trying to search.

I was in the lookout for communities or groups to discuss problems what tech leaders face, more specifically, what women tech leaders face. When I realised from my above tweet and after a bit of research that there weren't groups or communities to discuss women specific tech leader problems, I wanted to create a virtual space myself so that women could come and share problems, find solutions.

## Why do I want?

As a female leader in tech, sometimes I have my blue days and I was hoping to have a closed group to talk and rant over the day to day things. In the past, ~3 years ago in 2017, when I newly started out in opensource, it was overwhelming too. I contributed to Firefox devtools debugger and then I did Outreachy internship which was a game changer.

Last year, in 2019, I was helping co-organise the bi-weekly open source diversity calls, where people in open source used to gather and discuss how to make the space more diverse and inclusive. Prior to this, I was part of a closed open source maintainer cohort whose attempt was to bring more [diverse maintainers](https://princiya777.wordpress.com/2019/04/07/diverse-maintainers-in-open-source/) into open source.

During my mind-mapping activity I realised I wanted a similar thing about female leaders in tech.

## How do I want?

When I got to the `HOW` part, it made more clear to me about the earlier `WHAT` and the `WHY` topics. I started analysing similar activities from the technical and non-technical space. For example:
- Monica Lent's [blogging for devs](https://bloggingfordevs.com/blog/)
- Entertainment shows which I love to binge watch; for example: The Kapil Sharma Show
  - [Kapil Sharma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kapil_Sharma_(comedian)) is an Indian standup comedian who is known for his witty jokes and excellent comedy timings
- There are other examples too, but for now, let's stick to these two
- One thing that is common here is that both of them know their domain pretty well and are able to generate content and keep the audience engaged
- When I started to ask myself how do I want to create a closed space or answer in detail the `WHAT` and the `WHY` topics, it made sense to learn the subject matter and get better so that at some point (say in one year from now) I could lead the discussions myself or produce more content around these topics

## What have I found so far?

I have joined the below slack groups, and I am reading lots of articles by scouting through their old messages. I try to read ~3 articles per day.

I also found this interesting newsletter from [Patrick Kua](https://levelup.patkua.com/).

This github repository on [leading and managing](https://github.com/LappleApple/awesome-leading-and-managing) is in my browser bookmarks.

You can follow my blog where I try to document what I learn in this space.
