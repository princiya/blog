Think of a child growing up. The child is able to bring out the best from within based on a supportive environment and parents.

Replace the following:
-  `child` with a person at job
- `environment` with `team`
- `parents` with `leaders`

A child may not necessarily see parents as leaders, but if we look at it, parents are expected to lead by example, create a culture for respect and trust, and at some point create a space for the child to grow and lead their lives. As leaders, this is what we do too.

## Leading by example

A child grows in its parent's shadows and tends to do things following them. It is important to lead by examples and not just dictating upon how things need to be done.

_At my previous job working at a highly regulated digital health tech space, we had to follow strict compliance rules for Jira tickets; tickets needed to have a good acceptance criteria defined and all conversations tracked in comments. The rationale was that for every release all the digital artifacts would be stored for the next 10 years and during this time if any of our product development work led to any loss of a patient's life then we had to be able to track down the source of the cause._

_And also writing tests, we had to have a very high bar to writing tests and a threshold._

_Given how boring both these tasks were, we often used to skip or assume things were either spoken about a Jira ticket or write simple tests just to meet the threshold. As a leader if I wanted to improve this, I had to first do this and lead this by an example!_

## Respect and trust

Trust is the key part in any relation; be it personal or professional. A child blindly trusts its parents but as they grow they learn to distinguish between what is right vs wrong and identify whom to trust vs not. Leading by example is a good way to build trust.

Respect follows trust. It is important to be respectful in our deeds and actions.

> Respect and trust needs to be earned for both parents and leaders and this cannot be demanded!

_As a new Engineering Manager at Anaconda I was focused on building trust through my work, actions and commitments. I had to prove that they can trust me to do this job._

_Trust also means, to me, living upto the smallest commitments or statements that I might have made. For example: diligently following up on a task or helping a colleague to get their job done._


## Safe space to grow

While giving children a good life and education is important, they also need to grow to be confident and independent.

As leaders we want our teams to grow, to be able to do their work, while we are not being bottlenecks or micromanaging.



_When I have new joiners in the team, especially junior folks, I encourage them to ask questions or make sure they feel safe and comfortable to ask questions. No question is stupid!_

## Let go

It is also important to realise the spirit to let go, meaning, our job is to create a space for growth and make sure they have resources and space. But we also at some point need to realise that they may not come back or have other options to pursue.

## Notes

- It is not easy
- It is a big commitmment
- We are responsible for growing others
