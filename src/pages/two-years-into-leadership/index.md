July 01, 2020 is my two year work anniversary with [Curalie GmbH](https://curalie.de). It's been great two years until now, I have enjoyed working here every single day (there have been very few blue days) and I look forward to the upcoming challenges.

2 years ago, I was looking for a job change and was very much open to take bigger responsibilities and the Open Source Manager job at Zalando happened. Prior to this, I was working as a Software Engineer at Collabary (by Zalando). Although the job was challenging, I didn't qualify there to a higher pay grade. And my previous manager said I was going through the Dunning Kruger effect.

I was determined to get a better job, title and offcourse higher pay. 2 years now and I could not have been happier from where I am currently.
