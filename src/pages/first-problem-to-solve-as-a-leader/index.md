As of October 1, 2020, I officially have the title `Head of Engineering (Frontend)` where I lead and manage the Web and Mobile application development teams. I am incredibly proud of this accomplishment of mine 👩‍💻 👩‍💻 👩‍💻. You can read my journey into technical leadership [here](/tags/leadership). While I have been in the lead role since 2 years now, one thing you would often hear me saying to anyone is this:

> Coding is easy, but managing people is hard 🤦‍♀️.

## What makes dealing with people hard

Because, people are used to being people, a.k.a `humans`. We all have our own problems, fears, hopes and dreams. This is true, no matter who you are or what you do.

## What can we do about it

> Show empathy! 💯 Encourage open communication.

When I was a kid, I was always used to saying, `I want to be a good human being` whenever I was asked what I aspired to be as I grew up. I can only recall that I had read about this somewhere and ever since I have been very fond of this sentence.

Now as a leader, I always try to be empathetic and supportive, and cannot stress enough on the power of open communication between teams and peers. If I were to write a book on leadership, then the Chapter 1 would be:

> Manage effective commmunication within your team and be a good leader.

Below is a summary on how to improve communication patterns, appreciate each other and have better trust within teams.

## Communication patterns

- Tone of asking: Do not just ask a question, but also the reason behind the question when it is a slack message.

**Example**: `“Did you do this, I am asking because I am looking into the same thing now and have some follow up questions”` This helps in reducing the receiver's stress rather than `"Hey, did you do this?"` and the receiver having to wonder what the message could be about until they get to talk to the sender.

- Use emojis to have a pleasant feel for a written conversation.

**Example**: `"I don't understand this"` vs `"🙈 I don't understand this"`. The former can appear to be yelling at a person while the latter is a milder version of saying that you do not understand something.

- Keep others informed on what you are doing.

**Example #1**: A best way to update others is by documenting tasks. This also helps in sharing knowledge and enabling more than one person, other than yourself, to do what you can do. This helps a lot if you are a small team or a startup. I wrote a recent [post](../page-data/fix-openssl-python-aws) on how it took me 1.5 days to solve a particular task. This problem could have been solved if the knowledge was shared from the beginning on how to perform the same task which was normally done by another person.

**Example #2**: If you solved an issue differently or encountered problems while addressing an issue, write a comment on the ticket or code so that others don't run into the same problem. As developers we like stackoverflow because someone would have already encountered a problem that we run into.

## Pull request communications

While reviewing pull requests, use team specific options like `"Let’s do it like this"` or `"Can you please do this instead?"` rather than `Do it like this`. Use of emojis also is highly encouraged to maintain a calm tone while reviewing difficult or lengthy pull requests.

Write an explanation why you think your changes are necessary. You need to tell the person why your solution / suggestion should be considered and not have them wondering why their problem solving approach cannot be considered. It's very important to keep this in mind when you have juniors in your team.

Encourage everyone to participate in PR reviews. Some need more time to participate and review, especially if they are beginners; if needed include this effort in ticket estimations or story points.

## Appreciate each other

We are all humans and can always crave for appreciation in one form or the other.

- Appreciate your peers for their efforts in pull requests, leave encouraging messages especially for juniors or new hires. They will value your team culture.
- Like / comment when someone posts something useful in team channels or be prompt to reply
- Appreciate in the team channels what you found interesting, or a good practice someone did

> Appreciate junior / seniors,  men / women alike. We are all humans and like appreciation! 🌟

I found this nice article on [Power of gratitude at work](https://www.applauz.me/resources/the-power-of-gratitude-at-work).

### Examples

- Whom did you appreciated  today / this week? Go and do it now, if you haven't already
- Who appreciated you today / this week? Show them gratitude

## Building trust

> It is trust that transforms group of people into a team.

Trust and communication go hand in hand. When a child is born it immediately trusts its parents without even knowing what trust is and starts to learn and grow up. Trust is important in any kind of relationship, and so is trust important in everything that we do.

**__The first thing I had to learn when I started leading a team was to delegate tasks to others, and to do this I had to trust them to be able to finish the task.__**

It is very important that your team trusts you and vice-versa. Below are some of the habits which I have observed to be effective in letting your team trust you both as a leader and as an individual:

- Stick to your commitments, however small they are. Even if it were talking to someone and saying `"hey, we should get lunch together sometime! 🍲"`
- Don't procrastinate things; there can never be a better time than doing it now
- When someone asks you a question, post updates or follow up with conversations in a timely manner before the other person asks you the second time
- Be a listener, not just wanting everyone to listen to you. Let others lead, enable them to.
- Apologise your mistakes in public to your team. It is ok to do mistakes but it is your behaviour to improve that matters to the team. Beginners especially will then learn that everyone can do mistakes and there is room for error. Remember, we are all humans!
- Be consistent in all of these things mentioned above.
  
> Consistency is the key to earn or lose trust!

If you consistently do all the things mentioned above, then it is easy to build and earn trust; the opposite is true when you consistently fail on all of the above.

What communication patterns have you employed in your team or what was the first problem that mattered to you to solve as a leader? Do let me know. Thank you for reading. 🐱‍👓
