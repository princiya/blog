## DRAFT POST

This post is not complete! You are reading a draft version

- **Tell me about yourself** —> Mention what you want them to hear or know about you; your learnings, accomplishments etc. 
  - Keep a list of accomplishments ready
  - Important learnings, lessons learned
  - Learnings relevant to tech stack, general team building
- Interviewer always looks for —> tech competency, most importantly **learning + team fit** —> longer vision
- Buzzwords —> domain driven design —> people will catch you on those terms —> BEM
- Key learning is not to stress and just tell what you have learned from your work experience
- Watch out for expressions from the other person —> if they compliment you on your answers
- **It’s totally ok to tell**
  - I don’t know
  - I have used this but now I cannot recall and I might need to browse on the internet; plus one to ‘if I remember correctly’
- Keep questions handy to the interviewer
  - Also ask questions about what their accomplishments were, motivations to the other person
