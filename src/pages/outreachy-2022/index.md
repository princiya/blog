"Are you part of an underrepresented group (in the technology industry of the country listed above)? How are you underrepresented."
Could some light on if this is an essay question that requires a long answer?

If I say I'm under-represented as an indian female and talk about some statistics, wouldnt that make the answer too short?
Is there something else we could talk about?

yeah good point. most of the applications that I get to review do this. they mention statistics.
it's ok to mention statistics.
but don't write general knowledge things. rather keep the answer personalised.
in your case:
you are under-represented as an Indian female. have you felt this under-representation in college/work? how did you cope through this?
have you felt under-represented at an conference, meetup? how did you cope?
this way, think of specific examples where you felt certain way and end the answer in such a way that there is a section defining the challenge and another section addressing how you overcame that challenge?
I have seen folks sometimes talk only negative side, this does not give you any sympathy. instead better to use this opportunity to showcase a positive side of your in a negative situation.
makes sense? :slightly_smiling_face:
