Describe yourself in a short phrase.

strategic technical leader while also being hands-on delivery lead while encouraging a healthy, supportive and autonomous team environment.

As a creative mind, I take pride in knowing when to throw the rule books out of the window and think outside the box. I am able to work in a fast paced work environment and manage multiple projects at once.

A skilled programmer with strong communication skills and 12 years of experience building full-stack web & mobile apps, implementing CI/CD solutions, and supporting infrastructures, including 3+ years of experience leading technical teams at scale.

What are you looking for in your next role? What would you like to avoid? (Might include aspects like technologies you want to work with, industries you’re interested in, team dynamics, software development practices … whatever is important to you)

I am looking for a technical leadership role with a focus on hands-on work. Although I am an empathetic people leader, I would prefer to have dedicated coaches focused on people management to take over this role while I get to focus more on technical and hands-on development and deployment efforts.
I have started focusing more on the security side of things and currently learning ethical hacking, penetration testing, etc. and it would be nice if there is scope for me to learn and grow in this area.

Optionally, describe a project that you worked on that you are proud of. It's best if you can describe it from start to finish including the motivation and technical details. If you are describing a team effort, please be specific about your personal contribution.

Recently, I was part of the team where we converted a single product offering to a platform. At Curalie GmbH, we had started out catering to hip and knee digital rehabilitation offerings and in April 2021 we launched a new platform that can support digital therapies and rehabilitation services to any chronic illness. It took us about 6 months time to launch the first version of the platform from start to finish.
This was my 4th successful product launch at this company and as the Head of Frontend I was responsible for the following:
- Frontend architecture discussions. This was a real-time web and mobile application. We didn't use the Redux-based store but used Freezer.js to enable reactive programming.
- built a custom charting library from scratch to visualize complex medical symptoms and patient monitoring data to support React and React Native. My prior experience working with D3.js and visualizations was very helpful here to fasten the development time. 
- explaining technical concepts using mental models and metaphors to align stakeholders and various departments so that they could understand the platform better.
- setup of test automation both for web and mobile and supporting the manual QA team.
- infrastructure setup for mobile apps CI/CD from distributing apps internally to automated play and app store releases.
- timely pair programming and mentorship support to the team when in need.
- It did take lot of additional hours, since we also had to hire and onboard new people during this time. I am especially proud of this project because there was a lot of organisational chaos too which had to be sorted alongside implementing the technical solution. My special knack at managing and getting multiple things done, strong & open communication skills and good emphasis on documentation was appreciated by everyone.
